This is the code that I used for a bioinformatics course on Coursera, finding hidden messages in DNA (I). The class focused on motif-finding. 
My code ranges from easier tasks, such as finding a median DNA strand/string given multiple strings, to something like a randomized motif search. 
All code is in python, except the randomized motif search, which is in Java because I wanted to practice.
